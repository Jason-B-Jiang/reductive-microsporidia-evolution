This repo contains the environment and Snakemake pipeline needed to enact the main workflow in Figure 1.

## Prerequisites
- Local installation of Singularity >= v3.10

## Set-up
1. Clone repo to local machine, then cd into repo
2. Run set-up script to initialize Python virtual environment for Snakemake
   NOTE: if you run into permission issues, try running chmod u+x setup.sh

   ./setup.sh

3. 
   

## Running the main workflow

## Ancilliary scripts to create figures (to be run interactively)
Note: these scripts require that you have already run the main workflow, so all orthogroups and domain architectures have already been assigned to your input proteomes.
